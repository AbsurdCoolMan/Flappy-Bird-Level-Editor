# Flappy Bird Level Editor
 This is a HaxeFlixel project I made where it's Flappy Bird, but with a level editor. I've already made something exactly like this on Scratch, which got over 180,000 views. For a while now, I've been wanting to recreate that project outside of Scratch and here it is! Releases will be available along with an Itch.io page for the project. The project is obviously open source and it uses the MIT license, so you can basically just do whatever with it. I hope you enjoy the project, I'm working very hard on it.

# Compiling
 To be able to compile the game from its source code, you need to do the following steps.

 1. Install Haxe. If I were you, I'd install the latest version.
 2. Run the following commands in a command prompt.
    * `haxelib install lime`
    * `haxelib install openfl`
    * `haxelib install flixel`
    * `haxelib install flixel-ui`
    * `haxelib install flixel-addons`
    * `haxelib run lime setup`
 3. Open the project in a command prompt and run the command `lime test [target]` (Target being the platform. Ex. `windows`, `mac`, `linux`, `android`). If you want to just build the code without the game opening at the end, run `lime build [target]`. Sadly, compiling the code for the first time takes a little while depending on your computer speed. It could take up to 5 minutes, maybe 10, or maybe even an hour! If you have a problem with compiling the code, let me know in the issues page.
